Hi,

What you need to do is: 
run npm install
then npm run watch (should create dist folder)
go to extensions in brave or chrome. Turn on developer mode in top right corner.
then click load unpacked in top left corner and select the dist folder in the repo.
extension will show up as a card 
then click on Inspect views service worker which will open devtools window for background.js
There you'll see the "Unknown environment" error coming from FluenceAppService.js:85:1  

i have included browser-or-node to test the options they give ... None work, unfortunately. 

Finding out what would work is above my paygrade ;) It would be great if you can find a solution!
Please note that this is chrome extension Manifest v3, which has some major hotly debated changes since v2, but - as i understand - will become the standard. 

When you make changes in the code, the watch function will take care of the compile. You only need to click "update" in extension window and re-oen the dev-tools
